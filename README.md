# forest_fire_prediction
Machine Learning model to predict forest fire area based on weather and environmental factors.

This project predicts the burned area of a forest based on meteorological and environmental factors using Machine Learning algorithms.
The goal is to help authorities identify potential fire risks early and take preventive actions.

Dataset Used: Forest Fires Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
Model Used: Linear Regression (for predicting burned area)
Evaluation Metric: RÂ² Score

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned missing and inconsistent data
Removed outliers for better prediction
Normalized temperature, humidity, and wind columns

Model Training:
Trained and tested a Linear Regression model
Achieved good accuracy for continuous burned area prediction


 Future Improvements:
 Add Random Forest and XGBoost models  
 Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask for live predictions
